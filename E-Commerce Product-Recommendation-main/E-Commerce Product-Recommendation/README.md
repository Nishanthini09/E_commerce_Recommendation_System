# Product Recommendation for E-commerce

This guide will help you set up a simple E-commerce Recommendation System on your local machine using Streamlit and Python. The system allows users to filter products by category, select a product, and receive recommendations based on their selection.

## Installation Setup Guide

Follow these steps to fork the repository, clone it, and run the project using Streamlit.

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

    Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the repository page. This creates a copy of the project in your GitHub account.

## Step 2: Clone Your Forked Repository

    On your forked repository page, click the "Code" button and copy the HTTPS or SSH URL.

    Open your terminal or command prompt.

    Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project with the cd command.

    Clone the repository using the following command, replacing <repository_url> with the URL you copied:

    bash

    git clone <repository_url>

## Step 3: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

    Navigate to the cloned project directory using the cd command.

    Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    bash

python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

    On Windows:

    bash

.\venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS and Linux:

bash

        source venv/bin/activate

## Step 4: Install Dependencies

    Ensure you are inside the project directory and the virtual environment is activated (if used).

    Install the project dependencies from the requirements.txt file:

    bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Step 5: Run the Application

    Run the E-commerce Recommendation System application using Streamlit:

    bash

    streamlit run app.py

    This starts the Streamlit app locally, and you can access it in your web browser.
